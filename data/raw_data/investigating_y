INVESTIGATING CROSS-LINGUISTIC EMERGENCE OF /y/
	
	For this phase of the project, I have identified __83?___  extant languages containing the /y/ phoneme.

 	I learned of these languages through WALS, our previous research, in the 2013 Compendium of the World's Languages (reference below), and occasionally in other papers I was reading for a different language.

Campbell, George L., and Gareth King. Compendium of the World's Languages, Taylor & Francis Group, 2013. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ubc/detail.action?docID=1323282.
 
	This source proved quite useful. In addition to containing extant languages it notes the phonology of some extinct predecessors.
	 In the cases of Classical Mongolian, Classical Greek and Old English, we see languages that used to contain /y/ and now do not. 


		********	There are still a great deal of unanswered questions here to be explored, many of them may not have clear answers	**********

		That said, here's the quick version of what I've found: 




			TOTAL # of Languages with /y/ (often denoted as /ü/)	: 	79

				
	
"Pre-existing" within Primary 	(31)	Turkic, Turkmen, Tuvan, Yakut, Azerbaijani, Bashkir, Chuvash, Kirghiz, Uyghur, Kazakh, Altay, Gagauz, karachay-Balkar, Karakalpak, Khakas, Kumyk, Uzbek (some dialects)
Family Branch proto-lang:		Nganasan, Mari, Hungarian, Finnish, Selkup, Estonian, Ingrian, Veps/Vepsian, Karelian, Livonian, Votic, Kalmuck, Khorchin, Daghur,

		- This is a tricky category because it seems some of these languages may have lost /y/ and then redeveloped it through another method. For example, I have found evidence that Tatar /y/ arose from /œ/ (discussed with source below). 
		However, Tatar is a Turkic language and therefore its predecessor had /y/ already. I can't say for certain that something similar hasn't happened to the more of the languages above. 


	/u/ > /y/ 	:	(9)	Danish, Swedish, Faroese, Norwegian, French, Albanian, Bezhta, Dutch, Afrikaans 

	/œ/ > /y/ 	:	(1)	Tatar 

	/iu/ > /y/	:	(2)	Quiotepec and Yolox Chinantec

/u_[front high vowel]/>/y/ : 	(2)	German, Bavarian

/u_i/ | /i_u/ > /y/:		(3)	Manchu, Xibe, Chechen 

suspected fronting
by preceding consonants	:	(1*)	At least 66 dialects of Chinese


	Rounding harmony?	(8)	Lezgian, Tabasaran, Agul, Rutul, Budukh, Kryts, Udi, Khinalug

	Uncertain Origin:	(14)	Breton, West & East & North Frisian, Lhota, Occitan, Svan, Talysh, Tat/Tati, Iaai, Aikana, Natügu, Tibetan, Udege

	Yet to research:	(8)	Cantonese, Naxi, Lepcha, Yagnob, Cornish, Ejagham, Hopi, Wari'






			A number of the languages (that contain /y/) share a predecessor that contained /y/ as well, here are those groups:


1.	Originated from PROTO-NORSE (4):	Danish, Faroese, Swedish, Norwegian

	Where did /y/ arise from:		 /u/>/y/ in Proto-Norse due to umlauting circa 500-800 AD

2.	Originated from PROTO-TURKIC (18):	Turkic, Turkmen, Tuvan, Yakut, Azerbaijani, Bashkir, Chuvash, Tatar, Kirghiz, Uyghur, Kazakh, Altay, Gagauz, karachay-Balkar, Karakalpak, Khakas, Kumyk, Uzbek (some dialects)

	Evidence of /y/ in Proto-Turkic:	pg. 70 of Johanson, L., Johanson, É. (1998). The Turkic Languages. London: Routledge, https://doi-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/10.4324/9780203066102

	- Some reconstructed phonologies of proto-Turkic ancestor, Proto-Altaic, also include /y/ (pg. 5 of Bomhard, Allan. (2016). A Brief History of the Reconstruction of the Proto-Altaic Phonological System.) 

	Notes on Vowel Harmony:			As a general rule of thumb, Turkic Languages obey fronting and rounding harmony
	
	The big picture:			/y/ has been around in Turkic languages for a long time, still some evidence that it hasn't just carried over: Pg. 1654 in Campbell 2013 discusses Tatar, saying:
						"Proto-Turkic /e o œ/, generally preserved in Modern Turkic, are raised in Tatar to /i u y/; similarly, Proto-Turkic /i u ɯ y/ are lowered in Tatar to /e o ə œ/"




3. 	Originated in PROTO-URALIC (10):	Nganasan, Mari, Hungarian, Finnish, Selkup, Estonian, Ingrian, Veps/Vepsian, Karelian, Livonian, Votic
	
	Evidence of /y/ in Proto-Uralic:	Pg. 16 of Abondolo,Daniel Mario. The Uralic Languages. Routledge, 1998	

	Within Uralic, Proto-Finnic:		Estonian, Ingrian, Veps/Vepsian, Livonian, Finnish, Votic, Mari (disputed)

4.	Originated in PROTO-MONGOLIC (3):	Kalmuck/Kalmyk Oirat, Khorchin, Daghur

	Evidemce of /y/ in Proto-Mongolic: 	pg. 4 of Janhunen, J. (Ed.). (2003). The Mongolic Languages. London: Routledge, https://doi-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/10.4324/9780203987919

						Source stimpulates that /y/ preserved in languages where Back-front Harmony remains, and that Back-Front Harmony far pre-dates Open-Close Harmony (seen in more modern Mongolic languages)



5.*** 	Originated in Proto-Frisian ():		West Frisian, North Frisian, East Frisian 
	
	Evidence of /y/ in Proto-Frisian:	Pg. 95 of Vaan, Michiel A. C. The Dawn of Dutch: Language Contact in the Western Low Countries Before 1200. , 2017.

						/y/ present in reconstructions of phonology circa 700 CE. Then on Pg. 105, suggests /y/ absent in Old West Frisian, 



6.	Suspected predecessor to Lezgic	 :	Lezgian, Tabasaran, Agul, Rutul, Budukh, Kryts, Udi, *Khinalug*-(related isolate)
	branch of NE Caucasian branch    	- These could alternatively be a mixed bag of origins (in which case Azeri influence seems to be the most likely culprit)

	Notes: 	You had mentioned that Lezgian /y/ was the product of rounding harmony, but I haven't been able to find a source confirming that. Instead I found that every language in the Lezgic branch contains /y/ except for Archi and Tsakhur (in Tsakhur I believe /y/ may have become /ɨ/).
		Given that 7/9 languages in this branch contain /y/ it seems plausable that this sound shares a common origin in a predecessor language.

														THE SINITIC LANGUAGES:


This diverese group is getting its own section because it frustrates me. The terminology gets murky here with unclear distinction between dialects/varieties and fully different languages. 
The bottom line of it, however, is that these "varieties" represent a mixed bag of mutual intelligibility, and only some contain /y/. Additionally, reconstructions of Proto-Sino-Tibetan are 
under dispute and as such we cannot assert whether /y/ was or was not present. 

- Note that Pg. 388 of - Campbell, George L., and Gareth King, 2013 - describes phonology of Classical Chinese (the written language from the 6th century BC to the 3rd CE) as not including /y/. However, 
this was a written language not strictly representative of the spoken dialects of the time.

- Note that Pg. 87 of - Pan, Wuyun & Zhang, Hongming. (2015). Middle Chinese Phonology and Qieyun. - describes the phonology of 601 CE Chinese as not including /y/ according to the Qieyun dictionary published at tht time. 
Once again this reflects pronunciation of written language and may not reflect that spoken in 600 CE. 

-Late Middle Chinese had /y/ according to Pg. 80 of G. Pulleyblank, Edwin. Middle Chinese: A Study in Historical Phonology. 9780774854580. Vancouver: UBC Press, 1984.  
Canadian Electronic Library/desLibris. Absolute Page 1. Downloaded 28-05-2020. Copyright © 1984. UBC Press All rights reserved.
**Pg. 60 - "the sound glosses in Yan Shigu's [...] commentary to the Hanshu, completed in 641, already imply a sound system that departs radically from the Qieyun and shows the characteristics of LMC."* 

- Seems as if /y/ appeared between 600 and 640 CE, although it could very well have first appeared earlier

- **Ian Maddieson. 2013. Front Rounded Vowels. In: Dryer, Matthew S. & Haspelmath, Martin (eds.) The World Atlas of Language Structures Online. Leipzig: Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. (Available online at http://wals.info/chapter/11, Accessed on 2020-05-28.)
 "In the history of the Chinese languages one of the sources of the [y] vowel is a sequence such as /ut/. The tongue has to be moved forward to make the contact for /t/; 
consequently a more fronted position of the vowel is created and this pronunciation of the vowel becomes the new norm over a period of time. If the final consonant is later lost a change from [ut] to [y] is completed."




"Chinese" (86 dialects from Kejia, Yue, Gan, Jin,	- Zee, Eric and Wai-Sum Lee. “VOWEL TYPOLOGY IN CHINESE.” (2007) proved to be the single most useful source for these languages and it took some time to find.
Min, Tu, Mandarin, Xiang, Ping, and Wu families)	-	This piece examines the vowel inventories of 86 different Chinese Dialects, spannning all major dialect branches but not all of the dialects themselves
							-	Pg. 1431 : 66 of the 86 Dialects contain /y/ that's 76.7 % of them. The only more frequent vowels were point vowels /i u a/. /y/ was present in some varieties of all eleven dialectal families studied.
